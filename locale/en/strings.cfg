alt-rocket-fuel=Alternative rocket fuel
[technology-description]
alt-rocket-fuel=Technology introduces the concept of optimizing fuel proportions for the best performance. Through meticulous calibration and experimentation, it is possible to identify the optimal fuel mixture that maximizes thrust and enhances overall travel efficiency.
[mod-setting-name]
alt-rocket-fuel=Jetpack thrust of alternative rocket fuel
fuel_stack= Fuel stack size
fuel_emissions_multiplier=Fuel Emissions Multiplier
fuel_top_speed_multiplier=Fuel Top Speed Multiplier
fuel_acceleration_multiplier=Fuel Acceleration Multiplier
fuel_value_mod=Fuel Value
[mod-setting-description]
alt-rocket-fuel=0 = You can't use it as a jetpack fuel. Your jetpack will prioritizes fuel with highest thrust.(Max = 2)
fuel_stack=The fuel stack size. Default set to 50
fuel_emissions_multiplier=Multiplier for emissions produced by fuel. Default set to 1
fuel_top_speed_multiplier=Multiplier for top speed provided by fuel. Default set to 1.3
fuel_acceleration_multiplier=Multiplier for acceleration provided by fuel. Default set to 2
fuel_value_mod=Modifier for the value of fuel. Default set to 0.25GJ
